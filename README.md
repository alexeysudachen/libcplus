# libcplus-1 (legacy)
C alternative framework

It's my experement to make useful framework helping write C code more simple and robust. It workes good enough, however C++ is more stable and powerfull.

 The last version of C+ currently is in Xternal repository. I use this repository only for testing and experiments.
